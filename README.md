# React Router v6 Navigate Component Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `Navigate` component in React Router v6: using it outside of a `Route` element.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version.

## Problem

Placing the `Navigate` component outside a `Route` in React Router v6 can lead to unpredictable behavior. Navigation might not function as expected, or other rendering issues might arise.  This is because `Navigate` relies on the routing context provided by the `Route` component.

## Solution

Always ensure that the `Navigate` component is nested within a `Route` component. This ensures it has access to the necessary routing context to perform navigation correctly.
